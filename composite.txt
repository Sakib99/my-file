==========Diabetes is when your blood glucose* also called blood sugar is too high Blood glucose is the main type of sugar found in your blood and your main source of energy Glucose comes from the food you eat and is also made in your liver and muscles Your blood carries glucose to all of your body’s cells to use for energy ==========Literary analysis is a genre that in many ways resembles an argument: you make a claim about the work and support your claim with evidence from the text as well as reasoning and analysis The purpose of a response to literature is to persuade the readers that your analysis and interpretation of the work are valid reasonable and logical When you write about literature you participate actively in the construction of knowledge about the text That is to say the text itself creates only part of its message The writer of the work has done his or her part to convey its meaning by using symbols language setting plot character foreshadowing and the like to suggest the text’s message Unlike “hard sciences” however literature cannot be empirically tested in the laboratory; its meaning comes from its readers In fact literature begs for readers to read react to think about and interpret the text Having engaged in those steps the process continues with another step: communicating to others the meaning you as a reader have constructed from the text Your interpretation and analysis then add to the body of meaning about the text Most likely you have been asked to write about literature before: perhaps you’ve read a book and written a report or review of it for your junior high English class; perhaps you’ve studied an author and researched his or her life and work; perhaps you’ve read a piece of literature and answered essay questions about it on an essay exam Because literature is a focus of many English classes it is likely that you have had some experience with reading and responding to literature in your past academic life; in the university you will also read and respond to literature—even if you’re not planning to major in English Since many colleges and universities require their students to take a literature or humanities elective you will probably continue reading and responding to literature in college==========Your pancreas—an organ located between your stomach and spine that helps with digestion—releases a hormone it makes called insulin into your blood Insulin helps your blood carry glucose to all your body’s cells Sometimes your body doesn’t make enough insulin or the insulin doesn’t work the way it should Glucose then stays in your blood and doesn’t reach your cells Your blood glucose levels get too high and can cause diabetes or prediabetes ==========As a genre literary analysis differs from other types of writing you may have done about literature such as an evaluation For instance as an assignment for school you may have watched a play or read a story and had to write a review of it A review calls upon the writer to make an evaluation to describe and analyze the work in question The purpose of writing a review is to persuade the readers that your evaluation which is based on criteria is a sound assessment of the work (“Don’t read this book because it lacks a clear plot”) For example you can find reviews of books and music printed at online bookstores such as Amazoncom Here people who have read the book (or listened to the CD) provide their evaluation of the work to potential book or music buyers to help them make informed decisions With literary analysis however the focus is not on offering your opinion about the work; rather the focus is to interpret and analyze the text Certainly you offer your informed opinion of the text’s interpretation but you do not assess the merits of the text or tell readers whether or not you liked the work Literary analysis then tends to be more objective than a review might be For that reason literary analyses are written using third person pronouns Other features of literary analysis include a clearly stated thesis (often called a claim) that is supported by reasons and evidence from the text Writers use present tense verbs to discuss the work rather than past tense Why do schools put emphasis on literature? First literature is a way to experience a way of life a time period a culture an emotion a deed an event that you are not otherwise able willing (as say in the case of murder) or capable of encountering in any other manner Literature then
opens doors to new and different life experiences Second the critical reading skills that you bring to reading short stories poems novels plays as well as non-fiction are the same types of critical reading strategies that serve you well in any other type of reading that you do—whether it be reading a computer manual biology text a legal document or the like In order to write well about literature you must be able to read the text closely looking at its structure the words the author has chosen the characters’ motivations the patterns of language and literary devices Certainly you don’t read a biology text looking for 3 literary devices and uses of language; rather you read that text searching for an understanding of the structure of the interaction within an organism how the organism relates to other organisms the biochemical pathways involved in those interactions However in either case—reading a piece of literature or a technical document—you read closely and carefully looking at not only what the writer is saying but also looking at why it’s being said and how it’s being said Furthermore the critical reading strategies that you employ in reading literature heighten your sense of observation and draw upon your life skills For instance as you read a literary text and notice the characters you have to think about and respond to each character’s motivation (Why did she do that? What makes her “tick”?) Reading literature then enhances your critical reading skills==========Prediabetes is when the amount of glucose in your blood is above normal yet not high enough to be called diabetes With prediabetes your chances of getting type 2 diabetes heart disease and stroke are higher With some weight loss and moderate physical activity you can delay or prevent type 2 diabetes You can even return to normal glucose levels possibly without taking any medicines ==========Likewise being able to write about literature demonstrates your ability to read critically and engage in the higher level thinking skills of analysis and interpretation However it is unlikely that you will write a literary analysis paper outside of a classroom Literary analyses tend to be only a “school” assignment for most people (unless you work for The New Yorker or other literary type magazines) On the other hand the skills that you bring both to analyzing literature and writing about it are applicable to situations outside the classroom and to other writing assignments within the classroom Being able to construct a reasonable claim supported by evidence and logic is essential to many other types of expository writing tasks (as you can see from the types of writing in this text) Regardless of the writing task or audience it is essential to be able to communicate your ideas clearly and effectively whether you’re writing a feasibility report for your boss or a literary analysis paper for your teacher Often students are intimidated when it comes to writing about literature because they feel that they do not know enough about literature to write about it or that the author is surely hiding some meaning in the text that they just can’t find It is important though to keep in mind that readers are integral to making meaning with literary texts Readers complete the writer’s work bringing their own life experiences and ideas to it to make meaning Sometimes students feel as if the whole purpose of writing about literature is to be critical of the work—and that’s difficult to do if you happen to really like the work Responding to literature however does not have to be intimidating if you read carefully and critically 4 keeping your mind set on thinking about and analyzing the text and if you write about an aspect of the work that sparks your interest whether positively or negatively==========Type 1 diabetes which used to be called juvenile diabetes develops most often in young people; however type 1 diabetes can also develop in adults In type 1 diabetes your body no longer makes insulin or enough insulin because the body’s immune system which normally protects you from infection by getting rid of bacteria viruses and other harmful substances has attacked and destroyed the cells that make insulin ==========Working with two or three classmates discuss your answers to the questions about “Yours” Compare and contrast your thinking about the story with that of your classmates Did your group members have different answers to the questions? Are their answers and yours reasonable and valid? Why or why not? After discussing and thinking about your different interpretations of the story think about why three people could read the same story and come up with different albeit reasonable answers to the same questions Together write a paragraph explaining your thinking ==========Type 2 diabetes which used to be called adult-onset diabetes can affect people at any age even children However type 2 diabetes develops most often in middleaged and older people People who are overweight and inactive are also more likely to develop type 2 diabetes Type 2 diabetes usually begins with insulin resistance—a
condition that occurs when fat muscle and liver cells do not use insulin to carry glucose into the body’s cells to use for energy As a result the body needs more insulin to help glucose enter cells At first the pancreas keeps up with the added demand by making more insulin Over time the pancreas doesn’t make enough insulin when blood sugar levels increase such as after meals If your pancreas can no longer make enough insulin you will need to treat your type 2 diabetes==========Krista Williams’s essay begins by setting up the contrast between Esperanza and Holden then proceeds to discuss each character’s view of sex separately She writes her essay in third person without using “I” and she uses present tense verbs when talking about the text which are common features of literary analyses Although she does not cite from outside sources Williams uses plenty of evidence from the texts to support her argument about each character’s sexual issues and she connects those views to the characters’ cultural perspective Especially important to note is the fact that Williams does not rely on plot summary to tell us about the complete story of Esperanza and Holden; rather she brings in appropriate background detail only to support the point she is making She assumes then that the essay’s readers will have some familiarity with the texts==========Gestational diabetes can develop when a woman is pregnant Pregnant women make hormones that can lead to insulin resistance All women have insulin resistance late in their pregnancy If the pancreas doesn’t make enough insulin during pregnancy a woman develops gestational diabetes Overweight or obese women have a higher chance of gestational diabetes Also gaining too much weight during pregnancy may increase your likelihood of developing gestational diabetes Gestational diabetes most often goes away after the baby is born However a woman who has had gestational diabetes is more likely to develop type 2 diabetes later in life Babies born to mothers who had gestational diabetes are also more likely to develop obesity and type 2 diabetes Read more about diabetes and pregnancy in What I need to know about Gestational Diabetes at wwwdiabetesniddknihgov ==========One way to analyze literature is to think about the cultural and historical perspectives of the piece When literary work that was either written several years decades or even centuries ago it is often easy for us to forget to place that particular piece of literature in a specific historical framework It is easy to forget that the world was not as advanced as it is today It’s easy to overlook the fact that cultural and societal mores have changed For example if we’re reading Harper Lee’s novel To Kill a Mockingbird we might be appalled at the way the townspeople treated African-Americans in their community We might wonder why the jury consisted of all white men no women or African-Americans To understand the novel though it is important to investigate the cultural and historical moments of the text In other words we might need to research civil rights in the South during the 1950s to begin to understand why this particular text was so important in its time and why that impact is still felt today For another example Upton Sinclair’s The Jungle a novel about horrible working and sanitary conditions in the meat-packing industry in Chicago early in this century may seem bizarre to us when we currently have strict government regulations regarding the handling and processing of food products as well as “labor laws” to protect the worker==========Over time diabetes can lead to serious problems with your blood vessels heart nerves kidneys mouth eyes and feet These problems can lead to an amputation which is surgery to remove a damaged toe foot or leg for example  8 The most serious problem caused by diabetes is heart disease When you have diabetes you are more than twice as likely as people without diabetes to have heart disease or a stroke With diabetes you may not have the usual signs or symptoms of a heart attack The best way to take care of your health is to work with your health care team to keep your blood glucose blood pressure and cholesterol levels in your target range Targets are numbers you aim for ==========Other than exploring the historical and cultural perspectives of the work there are other ways to analyze literature including psychological Marxist biographical and feminist These methods are often employed by literary critics who want to revisit texts with new frameworks or lens to understand the text in new and different ways It is beyond the scope of this guide to give you background into these varied ways of reading a text However one of the more traditional ways to analyze a text is by using a formalist perspective In the formalist perspective the text is viewed to be a complete unit that stands on its own without consideration to external issues such as history economics biography and the like When using a formalist perspective you will focus on the text itself and its use of literary devices tone and language Formalist critics examine how the text works as a whole unit: how for instance do language and characterization create a unified text The formalist perspective is often called a “close reading” because with this method of analysis you pay close attention to what’s in the work—not what’s outside it
==========If diabetes makes you feel sad or angry or if you have other problems that worry you you should talk with a counselor or mental health professional Your doctor or certified diabetes educator can help you find a counselor Talk with your doctor about what vaccines and immunizations or shots you should get to keep from getting sick Preventing illness is an important part of taking care of your diabetes When you see members of your health care team ask lots of questions Prepare a list of questions before your visit Be sure you understand everything you need to know about taking care of your diabetes 
==========One technique for developing paragraphs in a literary analysis paper is to link your mini-claim to solid textual evidence Since a strong literary analysis relies on evidence from the text itself this is a helpful strategy to follow In addition though you must be sure to connect your evidence in your own words to the point that you are making You cannot assume that your reader will see the connection between the evidence you cite and the claim you are making Notice in Krista Williams’s essay how she states her mini-claim explains it supports it with information that is either quoted directly or paraphrased from the text explains the paraphrase or quote then brings in more evidence This explanation of material is sometimes called a “sandwich effect”: You tell the reader what the quote or paraphrase means to the overall argument The sandwich effect does not imply that your readers are stupid However since we all read material different ways and since you are taking the paraphrase or quote out of the entire context of the work your explanation helps the reader understand how you are interpreting the citation Think of the sandwich effect as the mortar between bricks in a wall: it fills in any gaps that the
reader may have and makes for a solid argument==========Even small amounts of physical activity help manage diabetes such as when you are physically active at work or home People with diabetes should aim for 30 to 60 minutes of activity most days of the week Children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes who are 10 to 17 years old should aim for 60 minutes of activity every day Not all physical activity has to take place at the same time Increase daily activity by decreasing time spent watching TV or at the computer Children and adolescents should limit screen time not related to school to less than 2 hours a day Limiting screen time can help you meet your physical activity goal ==========Along with paraphrases and quotes you may want to summarize sections of the text for the readers; however you want to avoid a plot summary in which you summarize the entire plot for the reader When you use a summary in a literary analysis you will want to summarize only a section of the text picking out the main idea and relating it to your purpose or claim Another way to use a summary in a literary analysis is to summarize events leading up to a particular quote that you want to use In this case your summary will be very brief perhaps one or two sentences and simply will set the stage for the quote Review “Paragraph Development: Using Summaries” in Chapter 8 of the main text for help with how and when to summarize==========Most people with type 2 diabetes use medicines other than insulin shots People with type 2 diabetes use medicine to help their blood glucose levels stay in their target range If your body makes insulin and the insulin doesn’t lower your
blood glucose levels enough you may need to take one or more medicines Diabetes medicines come in pill and shot form Some people take diabetes medicines once a day and other medicines more often Ask your health care team when you should take your diabetes medicines Sometimes people who take diabetes medicines may also need insulin shots for a while Be sure to tell your doctor if your medicines make you feel sick or if you have any other problems If you get sick or have surgery your diabetes medicines may no longer work to lower your blood glucose levels Always check with your doctor before you stop taking your diabetes medicines ==========So far this chapter has talked about how to write an out-of-class literary analysis one on which you will work for several days planning drafting and revising However sometimes you will be asked to write a literary analysis paper under pressure either in-class or as part of an essay exam Many of the strategies discussed in this chapter apply to writing an inclass literary analysis: You will still need a strong claim supported by evidence from the text effectively organized and presented If you are writing an in-class paper though you most likely will not have access to the literary text about which you are writing How do you incorporate specific evidence from the text into your analysis? How do you write an effective paper in such a short period of time? This section will offer strategies for writing an in-class literary analysis
==========Most people with diabetes should try to keep their blood glucose levels as close as possible to the level of someone who doesn’t have diabetes This normal target range is about 70 to 130 The closer to normal your blood glucose levels are the lower your chance of developing serious health problems Ask your doctor what your target levels are and when you should check your blood glucose levels with a meter Make copies of the chart in the section “Your Diabetes Care Records” to take with you when you visit your doctor Reaching your target range all of the time can be hard Remember the closer you get to your target range the better you will feel ==========In order to write a strong in-class literary analysis you will still need to engage in the reading strategies discussed earlier in this chapter Just as for any exam or pressure situation you must be prepared If you hav read carefully taken notes and thought about the text ahead of time you should be familiar with and prepared for any question that your instructor may provide you It is also important that you read the exam carefully and answer the question or prompt that you have been given Likewise you should approach the in-class paper much the same way you would prepare for an essay exam Review the chapter in your text on how to prepare for an essay exam for tips and strategies for successfully approaching an essay exam========== These tips can help you when you’re away from home: Get all your vaccines and immunizations or shots before you travel Find out what shot you need forwhere you’re going and make sure you get the right shots on time Follow your healthy eating plan as much as possible when you eat out Always carry a snack with you in
case you have to wait for a waiter to serve you Limit alcoholic beverages Ask your health care team how many alcoholic beverages you can safely drink Eat something when you drink to prevent low blood glucose If you’re taking a long trip by car check your blood glucose levels before driving Stop and check your blood glucose levels every 2 hours Always carry your diabetes medicines and supplies in the car where you can reach them in case your blood glucose levels drop too low In case you can’t leave for home on time bring twice the amount of diabetes supplies and medicines you normally need Take comfortable well-fitting shoes on vacation You’ll probably be walking more than usual Keep your medical insurance card emergency phone numbers and a first aid kit handy ==========Frost conveys one of his themes being the fragility of life in his poem “After Apple Picking” In this poem he shows a person who has “tired feet” from applepicking He is ready to quit This symbolizes that he is accepting death and is ready to go on to better things It talks about how he has picked “thousands and thousands of apples” thus showing the many things that he has done throughout his lifetime However there are yet a few things that he needs to do “and there may be two or three apples left to pick” before he dies It also mentions how there is one bucket left to fill However the narrator doesn’t seem too concerned to get that bucket filled; he is ready to quit The narrator also mentions about the cellars full of cider stored up for winter I think that this is symbolizing that the narrator has done many things in his lifetime to lay up treasures in heaven He is ready to go on to better more restful things In the winter there is no apple picking that has to be done Similarly in the winter or death time of the narrator’s life he doesn’t have to do anything because he has already lived and done “thousands and thousands” of things The image of the apples is a very good image for this poem also Apples symbolize opportunity and knowledge which the narrator has==========
